Guess the color!
The Color Game gives the user an RGB value and six tiles, all different, randomly generated colors. One of the tiles matches the color of the RGB value, and itâ€™s up to the user to discover which one!

When an incorrect tile is clicked, it disappears into the background. When the correct tile is clicked, all the other tiles and the header change to match that color. Easy mode gives you three tiles to choose from, hard mode gives you six. And, of course, new colors will give you new colors!
